22.05.2021 - The Slickest Bean - Game

	What is it about?
A mistake was made. You are a kidney and not a coffee bean- but you still somehow ended up in a grinder.
Jump from bean to bean to escape it. And better be stylish for extra points.

	What is next?
Core gameplay needs to be fixed and balanced.
Some mechanics still need to be implemented.
